It occurred to me that the situation was very nearly a prisoner's dilemma although not quite entirely so (if someone defects, their payoff is always the same regardless of the other guy's choice here, while in a true prisoner's dilemma it would have been higher had the other guy cooperated), but I wouldn't say that really mattered here because the questions themselves were stuff like whether or not yellow would be angry over what happened rather than something like whether or not purple's actions were appropriate or something, which is a completely different way of asking about everything that's more detached from my own personal feelings on the matter.","TechnicalDifficultiesFreeResp":""},"rt":350962,"task":null,"dv_name":null}]}
